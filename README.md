# Backward Racing

Note: Due to various reasons, I did not have time to implement this game. However, I would like to include my design.

Design: A monster is in front of you and chasing you. You need to back up your car at a fast speed to survive.

How To Play:

Press LEFT/RIGHT to control the wheel.
Press DOWN to accelerate. Press UP to brake.
You win if you arrive at the shelter before the monster eats you.
